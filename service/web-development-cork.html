    <h2>Web Development</h2>

    <p> Welcome to our Web Development Service, which is a part of our Web Design Cork Service.
    With Web Development, it is all about HTML, it is all about ES6 JavaScript and CSS. 
    <br><br>
    When we code your page, we use several things to make sure the Code will work with the Design. We don’t use any Templates, we code everything from Scratch. This means, after talking to you about your product, about your service or your visions, we use simple HTML5. We code it, we do the Markup and then we style everything with CSS or SASS. SASS is a Cascading Style Sheet preprocessor. At the end we use JavaScript/JQuery to set up your website and to make it more alive. 
    </p>

    <h2>Front End Development for Cork</h2>

    <p>So again, HTML is for the content and CSS is for the Styling. CSS makes sure, that everything looks good and 
    that the colours work together, it is more like a Design aspect. 
    JavaScript on the other hand, is something that makes your page alive and something that adds functions to it. 
    <br><br>
    For instance, if you use our website and you scrollt down, maybe you noticed the 
    Logo animation that is coming from the Left of the content scale to 1.1 that shows up web you scroll down.
    </p>

    <h2>Content Management System</h2>
    <p> We use Sublime as our Coding Editor and we work with several Custom Management Systems. 
    A custom Management System is very valuable, because it makes it easy to manage your day to day content and to add new Extras to your site.
    <br><br>
    The most used CMS in our opinion is WordPress. It is very easy to adapt new things or to install new functions. WordPress works with PHP and MySQL and our Customers couldn’t be happier to use it.
    </p>

    <h2>Static Websites</h2>
    <p>With Jekyll and GitHub, we have great tools at our hand with which we can built static websites. 
    Static pages are pages where you don’t change the content frequently, it is like a Flyer on the internet. 
    Jekyll gives us the possibility, to host pages on GitHub pages.</p>
