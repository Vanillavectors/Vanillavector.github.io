    <h2>Mobile First for Cork</h2>

    <p>
        Welcome to our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web Design</a> Service Page for Cork. 
        This is all about to improve or create your website for mobile phones or tablets. 
        <br><br>
        To do this, we work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries">Media Queries</a>, which are CSS Stylesheet options and 
        which are there for styling your website. With Media Queries you can tell the Browser, when certain pieces of content should be smaller and when 
        they should be bigger. Basically you tell the Browser how all the DOM elements should render, based on certain Screen Sizes. 
        Anther CSS Option that we use here is CSS Grid.
        <br><br>
        It is so important to implement a responsive Design to your website, because most of the time peple will visit your 
        website from a mobile phone.
        It is easily forgotten most of the time, but your mobile website is the number one thing you should 
        keep your focus on, when developing a Homepage.

    <h2>Responsive on every device</h2>

    <p>
        Even with Search Engine Optimization, so even Google says, that there is a Mobile first Index, which basically 
        means, Google will treat your mobile website, as the priority or number 1 website and after that 
        comes the desktop version.
        <br><br>
        Thats is why it is so important and with our SEO Cork Service, it is one of the biggest Factors.
        <br><br>
        Sometimes special kind of content, just don’t work on mobile. For example, sometimes there are Videos 
        not optimised for mobile or Tablet devices, sometimes Ads, Banners or Images are just not rendered in the right way.
    </p>

    <h2>User Experience</h2>


    <p>
        To improve the user experience from a mobile standpoint, it is important to improve all those things. 
        Logins, Navigation Bars and Buttons, should be easy for the User to tap on, also other special kind of elements like for instance the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)">Call To Action</a> Button. 
        <br><br>
